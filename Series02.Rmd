# Statistical tests: comparison of medians (or means?)
In this series of exercises, you will explore how to compare two groups of data, using non-parametric tests (or parametric tests… if it makes sense to do so).

## Make clear what is a statistical test, and when to use it.
Below are some questions to guide your analysis. You can answer them in your notebook, with a short sentence for each question.
  
  - What is a median? A mean?  
The median is the middle value of an ordered dataset, while the mean is the arithmetic average of all values.  
(Freedman, Pisani & Purves, *Statistics*, 4th ed., 2007)  

  - What is a variance? A standard deviation?  
The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, expressed in the same units as the data.  
(Freedman, Pisani & Purves, *Statistics*, 4th ed., 2007)  

  - What is a normal distribution?  
A normal distribution is a symmetric, bell-shaped probability distribution defined by its mean and standard deviation.  
(Montgomery & Runger, *Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers*, 7th ed., 2018)  

  - What is a statistical test?  
A statistical test is a procedure that uses sample data to decide whether to reject a null hypothesis about a population.  
(Montgomery & Runger, *Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers*, 7th ed., 2018)  

  - When to use a statistical test?  
A statistical test is used when comparing groups, assessing relationships, or checking whether observed results could be due to chance.  
(Altman, *Practical Statistics for Medical Research*, 1st ed., 1990)  

  - What is a parametric test? A non-parametric test?  
A parametric test assumes that data follow a known distribution, usually normal, whereas a non-parametric test makes fewer assumptions and can be applied to ordinal or non-normally distributed data.  
(Field, *Discovering Statistics Using SPSS*, 5th ed., 2018)  

  - What are the assumptions of parametric tests?  
Parametric tests assume normality, homogeneity of variances, independence of observations, and data measured on an interval or ratio scale.  
(Field, *Discovering Statistics Using SPSS*, 5th ed., 2018)  

  - What are the assumptions of non-parametric tests?  
Non-parametric tests generally assume only independence of observations, without requiring normality or equal variances.    
(Conover, *Practical Nonparametric Statistics*, 3rd ed., 1999)  

  - What is a p-value?  
A p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed if the null hypothesis is true.  
(Casella & Berger, *Statistical Inference*, 2nd ed., 2002)  

  - What is the risk of error when using a statistical test?  
The risk of error arises from Type I error (α), rejecting a true null hypothesis, and Type II error (β), failing to reject a false null hypothesis.  
(Casella & Berger, *Statistical Inference*, 2nd ed., 2002)  

  
  - What is the difference between a paired and an unpaired test?  
A paired test compares two related samples, such as before-and-after measurements on the same subjects, while an unpaired test compares two independent groups.  
(Altman, *Practical Statistics for Medical Research*, 1st ed., 1990)

## Effect of treatment over time
This is a very classical question in clinical or sport research: does a treatment-training have an effect over time?

To answer this question scientifically, measurements must be taken before and after treatment, and possibly later, in order to assess whether the effect is lasting or not.

### The data

Download the file ```PrePost.csv```

This file contains before/after measurements. The treatment is a rehabilitation training for individuals with cardiac conditions.

Before going further, you have to make clear what are the measured variables. What do they measure? What are the units? What are the possible values? What are the expected changes over rehabilitation.

Make a table, with one row per variable, and the following columns:
